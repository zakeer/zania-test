## Design the hypothetical API for this project if you had to allow for adding, removing and updating the elements. Consider long-term maintenance as well.


To design a comprehensive and maintainable API that accommodates adding, removing, updating, and reordering documents while considering best practices for long-term scalability and maintainability.

**API Design Principles**

1. **RESTful Design:** Adhere to REST principles for resource-oriented URLs, standard HTTP methods, and well-defined status codes.
2. **Clear Resource Naming:** Use intuitive and consistent names for API endpoints (e.g., `/documents`).
3. **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., `/v1/documents`) to allow for future changes without breaking existing clients.
4. **Input Validation:** Validate all incoming data using Pydantic schemas to ensure data integrity and security.
5. **Error Handling:** Provide informative error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.
6. **Documentation:** Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for the API, including usage examples.

**API Endpoints**

```
/v1/documents/
  GET: Get all documents ordered by position
  POST: Create a new document
  
/v1/documents/{document_id}/
  GET: Get a single document by ID
  PUT: Update a document (all fields)
  PATCH: Partially update a document (specific fields)
  DELETE: Delete a document

/v1/documents/positions/
  PUT: Update the positions of multiple documents
```


**Request and Response Examples**

**GET `/v1/documents/`**

*Response:*

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "type": "bankdraft",
    "title": "Bank Draft",
    "position": 0
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "type": "bill-of-lading",
    "title": "Bill of Lading",
    "position": 1
  },
  // ... other documents
]
```


**POST `/v1/documents/`**
*Request:*

```json
{
    "type": "new_type",
    "title": "New Document",
    "position": 5
}
```
*Response:*
```json
{
    "id": 6,
    "type": "new_type",
    "title": "New Document",
    "position": 5
}
```

**PUT/PATCH `/v1/documents/{document_id}`**
*Request:*

```json
{
    "type": "updated_type",
    "title": "Updated Document"
}
```
*Response:*
```json
{
    "id": 6,
    "type": "updated_type",
    "title": "Updated Document",
    "position": 5
}
```

**DELETE `/v1/documents/{document_id}`**
*Response:*
```json
{
    "message": "Document deleted successfully"
}
```

**PUT `/v1/documents/positions/`** (Same as before)


**Long-Term Maintenance Considerations**

* **API Versioning:** This allows you to introduce new features or changes to the API without breaking existing clients. When you make a breaking change, you bump the API version (e.g., `/v2/documents/`).
* **Clear Documentation:**  Maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation that includes examples and guides for using the API.
* **Test Coverage:**  Write thorough unit and integration tests to ensure the API's functionality and reliability as the codebase evolves.
* **Consistent Error Handling:** Define a standardized error response format with clear error codes and messages.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging to track API usage and errors, and consider setting up monitoring tools to alert you of potential issues.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Prevent abuse by implementing rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a certain timeframe.
* **Caching:** Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance.
